Finally, the limits can be calculated, once the input files 
1D_Data_Signal_Pe%.1f_Pp%.1f_Lumi%.0f.root and Data_Background_Pe%.1f_Pp%.1f_Lumi%.0f.root exist.

First TSysLimit has to be created with "Make TSysLimit". 
Note that the main function is in TSysLimit_searches.C.
The executable will require libstslimit.so, which will be created after make,
and thus you have to add this directory into LD_LIBRARY_PATH (You can simply use setup.sh in this directory).

Now, the routine can be run. It requires 3 parameters: the WIMP mass, the electron and the 
positron polarisation e.g.:
TSysLimit 1 0 0

This will run create a root file with the Lambda value for the 
expected exclusion. You can print the value with 
root -l 
.L print_sensitivity.C
print_sensitivity(1,0,0)
