This is CPU-intensive. In this directory, egamma_signal_single_mass, we will run only 1 WIMP mass 
Once everything works, you can move to the full scan of masses (egamma_signal_mass_scan). 
List the root files with selected events only for the neutrinos in Selected_Photons_Neutrinos.txt 

How to run :
root -l
.L CreateDataForSignalAndBackground.C
CreateDataForSignalAndBackground()
