Preparation :
The input files are the 6 root files with the selected events 
(1 for each process and polarisation configuration). 
List them in individual lines in Selected_Photons.txt. 
The file rew_input_20180416_pt_e_05.root contains Bhabha events for which no full simulation and reconstruction exists and were hence selected on generator 
level.
This file was preparted by Moritz. 
This is described in detail in section 6.1.6.3 of Moritz thesis

How to run :
