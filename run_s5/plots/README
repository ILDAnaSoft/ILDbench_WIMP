Prepartion:
Several macro files in ILDbench_WIMP/macros are used in
runDraw.C and runMakeSigAndBkgDist.C.
Those macros are automatically loaded as described in rootlogon.C.

Limit calculation for H20 senario:
This requires running runMakeSigAndBkgDist.C beforehand.
Move to tsys_H20_vector(axialvector/scalar).
make TSysLimit  (This compiles TSysLimit_search.C.)
python submitMassScan.py

Plot the result:
root -l plot_sensitivity.C
