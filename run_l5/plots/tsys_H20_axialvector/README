Prepartion:
Several macro files in ILDbench_WIMP/macros are used in
runDraw.C and runMakeSigAndBkgDist.C. You have to modify
the include file path with accordance with your environment.

(Originally it was designed so that it works without any modification
by using gROOT->LoadMacro(), but it became to be inconvenient 
when we made the macro to have a input argument for mass scan run.)

aux directory includes some auxiiary files prepared by Moritz.
These are necessary to run runMakeSigAndBkgDist.C.
